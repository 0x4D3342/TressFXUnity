- Correct bounding box scaling in import
- Add light culling for spot lights
- Check why sometimes depth testing does not work.
-> Tested in test scene: Occlusion / Depthtesting in Forward AND Deferred. - No problems observed!
- Fix spot light attenuation equation
- Simulation downscaling fix breaks simulation (force scaling todo!)

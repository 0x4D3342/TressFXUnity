		<h1>Ase to TFX file converter tutorial</h1>
		<p>
		For converting .ase files to tressfx compatible models you'll need a .ase hair spline and the asetotfx converter binary.<br>
		First, open the file called start.bat contained in the AseToTFX folder. It will start a windows command shell in the current directory.<br>
		Then, you have to call the asetotfx binary with 2 parameters, the first one is the .ase file and the second one is the output prefix.<br>
		Example: asetotfx.exe hair.ase hair<br>
		This will generate multiple files named hair_[n].txt. This files will get used in unity later.<br>

		</p>
		<p>
		After generating the hair files, move them to your unity project asset folder.<br>
		Now, let's generate the tressfx hair data assets. In unity, navigate to your hair data folder and right click in the asset browser.<br>
		Under "Create" select "TressFX Hair".<br>
		<a href="2.png" target="_blank"><img src="2.png"></a><br>
		This will create a new TressFX Hair object. The next step is to add hair data and simulation values to it. Click on it and the inspector will open.<br>
		<a href="3.png" target="_blank"><img src="3.png"></a><br>
		Fields: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Hair Model: The text file which contains your hair data.</li>
			<li>Make Both Ends Immovable: If this is checked both ends of the hair will be immovable.</li>
			<li>Hair Material: Your hair rendering material. Example materials are available in the Git repo in the assets folder (HairMaterials folder)</li>
			<li>Global Stiffness: Stiffness value used in global shape matching for hair section. Values range from 0 to 1 and the closer to 1, the greater the global shape constraint is applied.</li>
			<li>Global Stiffness Matching Range: The range of vertices in a strand that are affected by the global shape matching for hair section. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 meaning all vertices in the strand are affected.</li>
			<li>Local Stiffness: Stiffness value used in local shape matching for hair section. Values range from 0 to 1 and the closer to 1, the greater the local shape constraint is applied.</li>
			<li>Damping: Damping coefficient for hair section, which is used in the Verlet integration.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		If you configured all your hair settings, go on with creating a new gameobject. In the TressFX folder you'll find multiple scripts.<br>
		Add the TressFXLoader Script to the gameobject. It'll automatically add the TressFX script, which is the main TressFX class.<br>
		Now drag&drop your TressFX Hair assets into the Hairs array marked red in this image:<br>
		<a href="4.png" target="_blank"><img src="4.png"></a><br>
		It should then look like this:<br>
		<a href="5.png" target="_blank"><img src="5.png"></a><br>
		</p>
		<p>
		That's the main work, you now can add the BasicTressFXRender script or any rendering script you want and the TressFXSimulation class.<br>
		For adding the simulation you'll need to set the "Hair Simulation Shader" property of the script, just drag&drop the shader located in TressFX/Shaders/Compute/HairSimulation.compute in there.<br>
		The BasicTressFXRender needs the property "Hair Shadow Shader" set to the shadow shader located in TressFX/Shaders/HairShadowShader.shader.<br>
		That's it, Your hair should now get rendered and simulated. You may change the other settings on the Scripts for example set the headcolliders (sphere colliders).<br>
		For more info about that checkout the TestPrefab in the TressFX Demo scene.<br>
